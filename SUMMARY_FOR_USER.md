## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Configuration (Before Deployment)

### üî¥ **Critical (Must Do)**

#### 1. **Release Signing Key** (15 minutes)
**Why needed:** Required to publish on Google Play Store

**What to do:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/keystores/moieglise.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias moieglise
```

Then create `android/key.properties` with your passwords.

**Guide:** See DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md, Step 1

---

#### 2. **Live Stream URL** (30 minutes - 2 hours)
**Why needed:** The live video feature needs a real streaming URL

**What to do:**
- Set up your HLS streaming service (RTMP server, Mux, Wowza, etc.)
- Update Firestore: `liveStreams/main` ‚Üí `streamUrl` field

**Test URL (temporary):**
```
https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/img_bipbop_adv_example_ts/master.m3u8
```

**Guide:** See DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md, Critical Item #3

---

#### 3. **Security Rules** (30 minutes)
**Why needed:** Protect your Firebase database from unauthorized access

**What to do:**
- Deploy Firestore security rules
- Deploy Storage security rules

**Guide:** See ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md, Security section

---

### üü° **Important (Should Do Week 1)**

#### 4. **Content Data** (1-2 hours)
**Why needed:** App needs programs and videos to display

**Options:**
- **Quick:** Run the provided seed script (adds test data)
- **Manual:** Use Firebase Console to add programs one by one
- **Best:** Use the admin interface to populate real content

**Guide:** See QUICK_START_ADMIN.md

---

#### 5. **Backend API for Notifications** (2-3 hours)
**Why needed:** To properly sync device tokens for targeted notifications

**Impact if skipped:** Notifications still work via topics, but no per-user targeting

**Guide:** See ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md, Option 3

---

### üü¢ **Optional (Nice to Have)**

6. **Facebook App ID** - If you want Facebook login
7. **Custom App Icon** - Replace default launcher icon
8. **Admin Dashboard** - Web interface for managing content

## üéØ Recommended Deployment Path

### **Option B: Standard Deployment (3 days)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Day 1:** Configuration & content (4-6 hours)
- Set up signing
- Configure streaming
- Add content
- Deploy security rules

**Day 2:** Testing (6-8 hours)
- Test on multiple devices
- Fix any bugs
- Performance testing

**Day 3:** Play Store launch (4-6 hours)

## üé® Admin Interface Options

You have **3 choices** for managing content:

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Fastest)
**Time:** 0 hours (available now)  
**Pros:** No setup needed  
**Cons:** Not user-friendly  
**Best for:** Quick start, technical users

### Option 2: Custom Web Dashboard (Best UX)
**Time:** 2-4 weeks  
**Pros:** User-friendly, custom workflows  
**Cons:** Requires development  
**Best for:** Long-term production use

### Option 3: Backend API (Most Flexible)
**Time:** 1 week  
**Pros:** Automation, integration  
**Cons:** Technical setup  
**Best for:** Advanced workflows

**My Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (Firebase Console), then migrate to Option 2 as your team grows.

See **ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md** for complete setup instructions for all options.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. **Package Name**
Your app currently uses: `com.example.moi_eglise_tv`

**Recommendation:** Change to your own domain before first release:
```
com.moieglise.tv
# or
tv.moieglise.app
```

You cannot change this after publishing!

### 2. **Keystore Backup**
**CRITICAL:** Backup your keystore file to 3 different secure locations after creating it. If you lose it, you can never update your app!

### 3. **Firebase Quotas**
Start on the **Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan** from day one to avoid unexpected downtime.
